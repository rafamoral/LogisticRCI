Description: Here we provide an implementation of the linear and logistic regression-based Reliable Change Index (RCI), to be used with lm and binomial glm model objects, respectively, following Moral et al. <https://psyarxiv.com/gq7az/>. The RCI function returns a score assumed to be approximately normally distributed, which is helpful to detect patients that may present cognitive decline.
