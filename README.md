# LogisticRCI

All scripts used to reproduce the results in Moral, Diaz-Orueta and Oltra-Cucarella, "Logistic versus linear regression-based Reliable Change Index: a simulation study with implications for clinical studies with different sample sizes"

- LogisticRCI contains the latest version of the associated R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LogisticRCI/index.html)
- LogisticRCI_Vignette.html contains a vignette for the LogisticRCI package
- figures_paper.R reproduces the figures in the paper
- moral_et_al_scripts.Rmd runs the full analysis (warning: takes approx. 8 hours on a 1.2GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor to compile)
- moral_et_al_data_for_plots.RData contains the results from the simulations

To run the .Rmd file you need access to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. It can be accessed here http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/
